# Malware Pipeline Phase 1

## 1. Defining the Threat Model

This program assumes all input files are untrusted and potentially malicious

### Assumptions
- Input files may attempt to execute, evade detection, or consume excessive resources
- Filenames, extensions, and metadata cannot be trusted
- Identical malware samples may be submitted multiple times

### Primary Threats
- Accidental execution during ingestion
- File tampering or replacement after submission
- Resource exhaustion through large or malformed files
- File-type masquerading (e.g., renamed executables)

### Trust Boundaries
- External input directory → ingestion process
- Ingestion process → quarantine storage

### Design Implications
- Files are hashed before storage to ensure integrity and enable deduplication
- Files are read in fixed-size chunks to prevent memory exhaustion
- File type detection is based on magic bytes rather than extensions
- Quarantined files are stored with execution disabled and isolated from analysis logic
